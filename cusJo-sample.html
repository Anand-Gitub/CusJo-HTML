            <h4>About CusJo</h4>
            <p>
                Our origins start in early 2010. We realised even the best organisations were not accurately rewarding the real-time collation of their customersâ€™ experience and transforming it into immediately actionable analytics. By not doing so, they were giving up the opportunity to be truly customer-centric as well as outperforming their competitors through service innovations. Thus inadvertently compromising on their own aspirations for higher profitability, performance and fulfilment levels.
